# SECTION: System Information Setup
#
#   This section defines some of the information reported in
#   the "system" mib group in the mibII tree.

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string

syslocation  closet

# syscontact: The contact information for the administrator
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysContact.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  contact_string

# Subagent control
#

# The agent can support subagents using a number of extension mechanisms.
# From the 4.2.1 release, AgentX support is being compiled in by default.
# However, this is still experimental code, so should not be used on
# critical production systems.
#   Please see the file README.agentx for more details.
#
# If having read, marked, learnt and inwardly digested this information,
# you decide that you do wish to make use of this mechanism, simply
# uncomment the following directive.
#
  master  agentx
#
# I repeat - this is *NOT* regarded as suitable for front-line production
# systems, though it is probably stable enough for day-to-day use.
# Probably.
#
# No refunds will be given.
