Contents: input storage types.

Depends: io, data.

Architecture:
new/RRRR/NNNN.data
new/reconf/NNNN.data
new/journal.jnl

1. Append-new-msg task (one task per delivery, lock).
   messages are processed (region determination)
   and appended to the last file (getNextMsgId()) for given region.
   When a new region appeared, its pointer is written to the journal,
   and core notified.

2. Region reconfigure task.  When this task is active, no new messages
   can be added.
   messages are processed (region determination).

3. Message reading task.  Read messages from given file, offset for
   given region.  If there is no more files for this region, stop.

For each storage we keep:
1. next file number;
2. for each region:
   reading current file number + offset in the file;
   writing current file number + offset in the file;
