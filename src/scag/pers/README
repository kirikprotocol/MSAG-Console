         ---------------------

pers-repairIntStorage tool is intended for repairing 
personalization storages indexed via integer profile keys, i.e.
service, operator, provider storages.

The storage typically should have the following structure:
DIR/glossary                    # common glossary
DIR/service.idx                 # index file (DiskHash)
DIR/service.bin                 # data file (PageFile)

Here DIR -- a directory where the storage resides.

The tool should be run like this:
pers-repairIntStorage [--create] DIR/service

It opens and scan both index and data storage files and
print out their contents into logger.

If --create option is specified, the tool will create
a new storage in the current directory, with file names prefixed with "new",
for example:
./newservice.idx
./newservice.bin
