The text file contains message statistics for deliveries collected
during periods.

The file location is statistics/YYYY.MM.DD/HH.log
and so it contains records written during one hour.

The head of the file contains comment record prefixed with '#'
character:

# MINSEC,DLVID,USER,TOTAL,PROC,SENT,RETRY,DLVD,FAIL,EXPD

The following lines are records one per line, containing the folliwing
fields:

  MINSEC - minute and second of the record (MMSS). The statistics in
           the record is collected during the previous minute.  The
           number of seconds must be 00 when running, but may be
           different when informer is stopping;
  DLVID  - delivery id;
  USER   - user owning delivery;
  TOTAL  - increment of total number of messages (new messages added);
  PROC   - a number of messages passed to processing;
  SENT   - a number of messages sent during the period;
  RETRY  - a number of messages passed to retry queue;
  DLVD   - a number of delivered messages;
  FAIL   - a number of failed messages;
  EXPD   - a number of expired messages;

Example:
# MINSEC,DLVID,USER,TOTAL,PROC,SENT,RETRY,DLVD,FAIL,EXPD
5000,22,bukind,2,0,6,0,0,1,0
5014,22,bukind,2,2,6,0,1,0,0

Here we can see two records, the first was during 49:00 - 50:00,
the second was during 50:00 - 50:14 (informer was stopped).
