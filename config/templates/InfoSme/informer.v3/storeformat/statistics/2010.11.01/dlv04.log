The text file contains periodic delivery statistics by users.

The file location is statistics/YYYY.MM.DD/dlvHH.log
and so it contains records written during one hour.

The head of the file contains comment record prefixed with '#'
character:
# MINSEC,USER,PAUSED,PLANNED,ACTIVE,FINISH,CANCEL

The following lines are records one per line, containing the following
fields:

  MINSEC  - minute and second of the record (MMSS). The statistics in
            the record is collected during the previous minute.  The
            number of seconds must be 00 when running, but may be
            different when informer is stopping;
  USER    - user id;
  PAUSED  - how many times deliveries switched to paused;
  PLANNED - how many times deliveries switched to planned;
  ACTIVE  - how many times deliveries switched to active;
  FINISH  - how many times deliveries switched to finished;
  CANCEL  - how many times deliveries switched to cancelled.

Example:
# MINSEC,USER,PAUSED,PLANNED,ACTIVE,FINISH,CANCEL
2000,bukind,0,0,1,1,0

Note, that in this example the single delivery switched to
