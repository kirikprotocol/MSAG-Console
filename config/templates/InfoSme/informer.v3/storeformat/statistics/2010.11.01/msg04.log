The text file contains periodic message statistics by deliveries.

The file location is statistics/YYYY.MM.DD/msgHH.log
and so it contains records written during one hour.

The head of the file contains comment record prefixed with '#'
character:

# MINSEC,DLVID,USER,NEW,PROC,DLVD,FAIL,EXPD,SMSDLVD,SMSFAIL,SMSEXPD

The following lines are records one per line, containing the folliwing
fields:

  MINSEC  - minute and second of the record (MMSS). The statistics in
            the record is collected during the previous minute.  The
            number of seconds must be 00 when running, but may be
            different when informer is stopping;
  DLVID   - delivery id;
  USER    - user owning delivery;
  NEW     - a number of new messages added;
  PROC    - a number of messages passed to processing;
  DLVD    - a number of delivered messages;
  FAIL    - a number of failed messages;
  EXPD    - a number of expired messages;
  SMSDLVD - a number of delivered sms (approximate); 
  SMSFAIL - a number of failed sms (approximate);
  SMSEXPD - a number of expired sms (approximate);

Example:
# MINSEC,DLVID,USER,NEW,PROC,DLVD,FAIL,EXPD,SMSDLVD,SMSFAIL,SMSEXPD
5000,22,bukind,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
5014,22,bukind,2,2,1,0,0,3,0,0

the second was during 50:00 - 50:14 (informer was stopped).
