The text file contains activity log for given delivery.

The file location relative to the delivery directory is 
activity_log/YYYY.MM.DD/HH/MM.log
and so it contains records written during one minute.

The head of the file contains the names of the fields, along with
statistics pseudo-comment record.
These lines are prefixed with '#' character:

#V SEC,STATE,REGID,MSGID,RETRY/NSMS,PLAN,SUBSCRIBER,TTL,SMPP,USERDATA,TEXT
# TOTAL=0,PROC=0,SENT=0,RTRY=0,DLVD=0,FAIL=0,EXPD=0,SMSDLVD=0,SMSFAIL=0,SMSEXPR=0,KILL=0

Here V will be the version number of the file format.

The following lines are records one per line, containing the fields
according to their names:
  SEC      - the number of seconds in the format SS, [00..59];
  STATE    - message state, a char one of 'N', 'P', 'R', 'D', 'F', 'E',
             'B', 'K' for new, proc, retry, dlvd, fail, expired,
             banned (marked to be killed), killed respectively;
  REGID    - region id, positive integer [0..];
  MSGID    - message id, positive integer [1..];
  RETRY    - retry count for retry record (R), or
  NSMS     - the number of sms chunks for final records (DFEK);
  PLAN     - how much time to wait until next retry, seconds;
  SUBSCRIBER - the ISDN of the subscriber;
  TTL      - time to live of the message, seconds [0..];
  SMPP     - the smpp code;
  USERDATA - user data ASCII string;
  TEXT     - the escaped text of the message.

NOTE: banned record (B) is only a mark for removal of the message,
so it won't contain much information about the message.

#1 SEC,STATE,REGID,MSGID,RETRY/NSMS,PLAN,SUBSCRIBER,TTL,SMPP,USERDATA,TEXT
# TOTAL=5000,PROC=737,SENT=10,RTRY=0,DLVD=253,FAIL=0,EXPD=0,SMSDLVD=253,SMSFAIL=0,SMSEXPD=0,KILL=0
